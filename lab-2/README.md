Collaborations and resources: <br>
I used this tutorial to help explain how to use the Leaflet Canvas Flowmap plugin: https://neiugis.github.io/lab6/ <br>
I also looked at the Github repository for the plugin (https://github.com/jwasilgeo/Leaflet.Canvas-Flowmap-Layer). The animation and interaction sections of the README were especially useful.
