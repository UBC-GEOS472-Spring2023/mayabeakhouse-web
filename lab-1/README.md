This is a map of food assets in Vancouver's Westside neighbourhoods. Last semester, through my work at UBC's Center for Community Engaged Learning, I had the opportunity to help with two asset-mapping workshops at Kitsilano Neighbourhood House. In these workshops, community members use stickers to pinpoint assets by hand on large, printed-out maps of each Westside neighbourhood. Community members mapped a variety of locations which contribute to their community's resilience. After these events, I converted the paper maps into a singular digital map, using Google My Maps. The original map can be viewed [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1jAnHow_6mJTe-SMInLCTOGm7eXybwBM&ll=49.24869535560273%2C-123.13576499785472&z=12). While the original map was functional, for this lab, I wanted to take this data and make it into something more professional-looking and aesthetically-pleasing. In addition, the original map contained data for many types of assets, but this map will only focus on food assets. 

For the data used in this map, it is important to note that this data is imperfect, and by no means comprehensive. Only food assets suggested by workshop participants are included in this map. For example, many participants added their neighbourhood grocery stores to the map, but many grocery stores are also missing. However, there are benefits to this method of data collection. This map emphasizes the food assets which community members know about, value, and/or interact with regularly. There are also assets on here which would probably never made it onto the map if data were collected another way, such as the blackberry bushes, community fridge, and a neighbourhood pantry (things that can't be found on google!)

The purpose of the asset mapping workshops was for community members to share their knowledge of community food assets with each other, and to highlight areas of strenghth in the community, and opportunities for improvement. By digitizing and publishing the workshop results, participants  will be able to more easily refer back to what was shared at the workshop. Furthermore, this map extends the reach of this knowledge-sharing beyond just the people who were present at the workshop. The intended audience would be anyone living in Vancouver's Westside, especially someone who might be looking for a low-cost meal, or a way to get involved in building a resilient food system for their community. My goals in creating this map were to make it simple, not too overwhelming to look at, and intuitive to navigate and use. A large number of the workshop participant were seniors, many of whom were not as familiar with technology, so I wanted this map to work for them too!
