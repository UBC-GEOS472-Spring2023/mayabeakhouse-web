This is a map of food assets in Vancouver's Westside neighbourhoods. Last semester, through my work at UBC's Center for Community Engaged Learning, I had the opportunity to help with two asset-mapping workshops at Kitsilano Neighbourhood House. In these workshops, community members use stickers to pinpoint assets by hand on large, printed-out maps of each Westside neighbourhood. Community members mapped a variety of locations which contribute to their community's resilience. After these events, I converted the paper maps into a singular digital map, using Google My Maps. The original map can be viewed [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1jAnHow_6mJTe-SMInLCTOGm7eXybwBM&ll=49.24869535560273%2C-123.13576499785472&z=12). While the original map was functional, for this lab, I wanted to take this data and make it into something more professional-looking and aesthetically-pleasing. In addition, the original map contained data for many types of assets, but this map will only focus on food assets.
