This is a map of food assets in Vancouver's Westside neighbourhoods. Last semester, through my work at UBC's Center for Community Engaged Learning, I had the opportunity to help with two asset-mapping workshops at Kitsilano Neighbourhood House. In these workshops, community members use stickers to pinpoint assets by hand on large, printed-out maps of each Westside neighbourhood. Community members mapped a variety of locations which contribute to their community's resilience. After these events, I converted the paper maps into a singular digital map, using Google My Maps. The original map can be viewed [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1jAnHow_6mJTe-SMInLCTOGm7eXybwBM&ll=49.24869535560273%2C-123.13576499785472&z=12). While the original map was functional, for this lab, I wanted to take this data and make it into something more professional-looking and aesthetically-pleasing. In addition, the original map contained data for many types of assets, but this map will only focus on food assets. 

For the data used in this map, it is important to note that this data is imperfect, and by no means comprehensive. Only food assets suggested by workshop participants are included in this map. For example, many participants added their neighbourhood grocery stores to the map, but many grocery stores are also missing. However, there are benefits to this method of data collection. This map emphasizes the food assets which community members know about, value, and/or interact with regularly. There are also assets on here which would probably never made it onto the map if data were collected another way, such as the blackberry bushes, community fridge, and a neighbourhood pantry (things that can't be found on google!)The purpose of the asset mapping workshops was for community members to share their knowledge of community food assets with each other, and to highlight areas of strenghth in the community, and opportunities for improvement. By digitizing and publishing the workshop results, participants  will be able to more easily refer back to what was shared at the workshop. Furthermore, this map extends the reach of this knowledge-sharing beyond just the people who were present at the workshop. The intended audience would be anyone living in Vancouver's Westside, especially someone who might be looking for a low-cost meal, or a way to get involved in building a resilient food system for their community. My goals in creating this map were to make it simple, not too overwhelming to look at, and intuitive to navigate and use. A large number of the workshop participant were seniors, many of whom were not as familiar with technology, so I wanted this map to work for them too!

I downloaded the data points from the original Google My Map as a csv, and then converted it into a geojson. I modified Mapbox's Mapbox Light style template to create a custom style. I chose to use a very light blue-grey as the base, with a very light greyish-green for greenspaces, and a muted cream colour for the buildings (as part of Mapbox Light's default, buildings show only when zoomed in all the way). Features like greenspace, buildings, and roads are not the most important thing on this map - I wanted the food assets to stand out - however, I do think it is important for these features to be recognizable, because map viewers might reference streets or nearby parks to help them navigate to these locations, or see where the locations are in relation tho their home. I also slightly changed the fonts to look more like UBC Centre for Community Engaged Learning's branding. I added the data points to the Mapbox style, and applied a different symbol colour to each category of food asset (free/low-cost meals and/or ingredients, community gardens, grocery stores, fruit bushes, and 'other'). I chose one of the more saturated colour pallets for 5 classes of qualitative data, from [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/). After creating the custom style, I created an html file to edit the code in. I followed a Mapbox tutorial to add pop-ups to the points, and changed the fonts to match the rest of the map. I also added a title and description (the same title and description as the original Google My Map). I had originally planned to code the legend in, but I was finding this very difficult and ended up just creating a png image of how I wanted the legend to look and overlaying that onto the map. 

Some things that I think could be interesting and useful to add would be a way to filter results to only show one category of food asset, and a way to search for a specific asset. At the moment, there are not a lot of data points, so it is not much of an issue to look at them all at once, however, it is my hope that more data points can be added in the future as community members contribute them, in which case, it would be very useful to be able to filter or search. In the future, I would also like to make the pop-ups more aesthetically pleasing, and update them with more informative descriptions and a link to a relevant website for the asset. I also think it would be helpful to add buttons to zoom in and out - right now this can be done by scrolling, but buttons would make the map more accessible on devices that are harder to scroll on.
